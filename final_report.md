# Final Project Summary

## 1. Project Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze the relationship between news sentiment and stock price movements by combining financial market data and headline sentiment analysis.


## 2. Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and normalized stock price data
- Cleaned and aligned news headline data
- Matched news and stock data using trading dates

### Sentiment Analysis
- Headlines were analyzed using a sentiment scoring model
- Each headline was assigned a sentiment polarity score

### Correlation Analysis
- Daily average sentiment scores were computed per stock
- Stock returns were calculated from closing prices
- Pearson correlation was computed between sentiment scores and stock returns

## 3. Key Results
- Some stocks showed moderate positive correlation between news sentiment and price movements
- Other stocks showed weak or no clear correlation
- News sentiment alone is not a perfect predictor, but can enhance market trend analysis


## 4. Limitations
- Headlines alone may not capture full market sentiment
- External macroeconomic events are not included
- No real-time data integration


## 5. Future Improvements
- Add article body sentiment analysis
- Use machine learning models for prediction
- Extend analysis to more markets and sectors


## 6. Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated how news sentiment can be combined with stock data to reveal insights into market behavior. This approach can be extended for more advanced financial analytics.
